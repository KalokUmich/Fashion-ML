*In Progress: Jupyter Lab w/ Git extension so no one has to download 60,000 image files. Alternative is Kaggle built in notebooks, will check for Git.

### MDST Fall 2020: MNIST/Fashion Machine Learning (and maybe more!)

## Intro

Hello all! Welcome to the humble beginnings of the *Fashion* project for MDST Fall 2020! This project is more introductory than free form, but that also means that if we get through the introductory stuff at a decent pace, we have the opportunity to be creative and go beyond. 

The classic MNIST data set looks something like this: ![these images](https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Plot-of-a-Subset-of-Images-from-the-MNIST-Dataset.png). 

**If you want to try this data set for yourself, you can find it [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)**. 

This handwritten number set is the "Hello World" of machine learning, and is a good place to start off. A successful algorithm would classify each of the shown as a correct number, but notice how issues could arise with the diagonal 1, or classifying a 2 written with the curl and without the curl, if the algorithm or training set is poor. Fortunately, at least for the introductory stuff we don't need to worry about bad input data. 

The Fashion MNIST data set, rather than numbers, includes an extensive amount of clothing, split up into 10 categories for the sake of the training set. Fashion MNIST is a great benchmark, similar to classic MNIST, that a machine learning algorithm works well. 

Some examples of images in the Fashion MNIST data set: ![gaming](https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Plot-of-a-Subset-of-Images-from-the-Fashion-MNIST-Dataset-1024x768.png)

Now that the intro is out of the way, we can start to establish some goals for the project

## Primary Goals:
1.  Learn about machine learning algorithms (CNN, etc) and popular Python ML libraries (Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, Sklearn, we can pick and choose) 
2.  Progressively make more complex and efficient algorithms and check against the Fashion MNIST data set. 
3.  In the end, make a classifier that can successfully classify different articles of clothing. 

## Reach Goals, (if we have time at the end):

Do something creative related to ML and fashion

Jed's preliminary ideas (feel free to add more!):
1. Frame-by-frame video analysis of runway models from different angles, trying to classify (may be hard to get data)
2. Progressively harder images with multiple articles of clothing (may need to do image resizing, any **EECS 280** people catch my drift?
3. App/Program that can classify one's outfit with a photo/video, or maybe even classify movement (significantly more of a reach)






## A Note to All:

As the project leader, I want to make sure that this goes well, but I also want to respect everyone's current situations, so we can dictate the pace of the project together. I also don't have a ton of ML experience, but I have a passion to learn, a good amount of math under my belt, and a lot of moxie. There may be times where I don't know the answer right away, or you may encounter a concept that I am not the strongest in, but I assure you I will try to figure it out with you, and we will get the bread. 

I live by the philosophy that if one can teach something, they know it well, and I will try to become a great teacher. If anyone also wants to chill, talk, or just vent, hit me up! I'm looking forward to working with everyone and to make something awesome!

## Another Note to All:

My friends call me Impostor God btw. Git Gud. (Pun intended)
